# MAD - Level 6: Example

This Mobile Application is developed as part of the introduction to the Mobile Application Development at HvA.
The application is used as an introduction to external API calls using OkHttp and Retrofit.

This application shows a user a bunch of images that show colors which are fetched from http://singlecolorimage.com/ .

Tapping on the image will make a Snackbar pop-up revealing the name of the color.
